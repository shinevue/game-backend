title: Raw SQL Queries

<Warning>
    This is an advanced topic.

    It's easier, safer, and less error prone to use the provided database query functionality wherever possible. See [here](/build/database) for more information.
</Warning>

Occasionally you need to use [raw SQL queries](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries). This is helpful for use cases where you need to:

- build advanced queries for filtering & manipulating data
- use custom Postgres plugins that aren't supported by Prisma
- optimize for fewer round trips to the database

## Building Raw Queries

To write raw queries in OpenGB, you need to use [`$queryRawUnsafe`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries#queryrawunsafe) and [`$executeRawUnsafe`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries#executerawunsafe). Do not use [`$queryRaw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries#queryraw) and [`$executeRaw`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/queries/raw-database-access/raw-queries#executeraw).

Your query must use the `ctx.dbSchema` value to select from the correct [Postgres schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html) (not to be confused with the [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview)).

For example, to query all usernames:

```typescript
interface User {
    id: string,
    username: string,
}

export async function run(
	ctx: ScriptContext,
	req: Request,
): Promise<Response> {
    const users = await ctx.db.$queryRawUnsafe<User[]>(
        `
        SELECT "id", "username"
        FROM "${ctx.dbSchema}"."User"
        `
    );

    // ...
}
```

This will run the following query:

```sql
SELECT "id", "username"
FROM "module_users"."User"
```

### Safely passing variables to the query

<Warning>
    Read this section carefully if passing user-provided values to the query.
    
    SQL injection is game-over for your backend.
</Warning>

In order to pass data to the query, it's important to do this safely. You can write parameterized queries where each argument corresponds to a provided parameter, similar to a regular function.

In this example, `$1` corresponds to `req.userId` and `$2` corresponds to `req.createdAfter`:

```typescript
interface User {
    id: string,
    username: string,
}

export async function run(
	ctx: ScriptContext,
	req: Request,
): Promise<Response> {
    const users = await ctx.db.$queryRawUnsafe<User[]>(
        `
        SELECT "id", "username"
        FROM "${ctx.dbSchema}"."User"
        WHERE "id" = $1 AND "createdAt" > $2
        `,
        req.userId,  // This gets injected to $1
        req.createdAfter,  // This gets injected to $2
    );

    // ...
}
```

<Warning>
    Never directly inject user-provided values to a query:

    ```typescript
    // IMPORTANT: Never write queries like this
    const users = await ctx.db.$queryRawUnsafe<User[]>(
        `
        SELECT "id", "username"
        FROM "${ctx.dbSchema}"."User"
        WHERE "id" = '${req.userId}' AND "createdAt" > ${req.createdAfter}
        `,
    );
    ```

    This will expose a serious security flaw in your backend via [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).
</Warning>

### Converting `$queryRaw` to `$queryRawUnsafe`

<Info>
    This section is only relevant if you're already familiar with `$queryRaw`.
</Info>

If you are already familiar `$queryRaw`, it's easy (and safe) to move to `$queryRawUnsafe`.

Here is an example before & after migrating to `$queryRawUnsafe`:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Before
// IMPORTANT: This will not work in OpenGB because it does not define the schema
const users = await ctx.db.$queryRaw<User[]>`
    SELECT "id", "username"
    FROM "User"
    WHERE "id" = ${req.userId} AND "createdAt" > ${req.createdAfter}
`;
```

```typescript After
// This will work in OpenGB because it uses `ctx.dbSchema`
const users = await ctx.db.$queryRawUnsafe<User[]>(
    `
    SELECT "id", "username"
    FROM "${ctx.dbSchema}"."User"
    WHERE "id" = $1 AND "createdAt" > $2
    `,
    req.userId,
    req.createdAfter,
);
```

</CodeGroup>

Referencing `ctx.dbSchema` does not work in `$queryRaw` because strings can not be used as placeholders for schema names.

## FAQ

### What are schemas & why are they used?

Each modules' tables are isolated in their own Postgres schema. This allows for tables with the same name (i.e. `Users`) across multiple modules (e.g. `"module_foo"."User"` and `"module_bar"."User"`).

In order to query modules' tables, the query must explicitly state the shcema of the table in your query. For example: instead of `SELECT * FROM "User"`, you need to use `SELECT * FROM "module_users"."User"`.

To achieve this, the schema for the module needs to be dynamically injected in to the query.

### Why are schema names dynamic?

The name of the schema the table lives in may change depending on the module's alias. This allows for [running multiple instances of the same module](/concepts/multiple-games) in a single database and prevent naming conflicts between modules.

### Why not use `SET search_path = "..."`?

Postgres allows you to set the `search_path` setting to define which schemas to find tables in.

Doing this has two major problems:

- We need to run this query before every modules' script runs if sharing a connection, adding a round trip to the database
- This is not supported in many database driver

### Why not use a pool for each module?

It's possible to work around this issue by using a pool for each module and running `SET search_path = "..."` once when the connection is acquired.

This has two problems:

- Connections cannot be shared between modules. If you have 10 modules, you need to have _at least_ 10 connections open. Postgres has a [default connection limit of 100](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS) connections, which will get exhausted quickly if using separate pools under load.
- Some database drivers or database providers do not support setting the `search_path` because of how they handle connection pooling under the hood.
