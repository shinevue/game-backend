  Please read Open Game Backend's [roadmap](/concepts/roadmap) for known limitations.

[Pragma](https://pragma.gg/) was founded in 202. Both platforms have similar limitations, so we'll compare them in the same document.

## What Pragma does well

- Source-disclosed engine

## How Pragma and Open Game Backend compare

### Source-discord vs open-source

### Prefab backend vs modular backend

Pragma provides a predefined set of features out of the box. While you can modify Pragma to extend it with your own features, you must have a license to the engine 

Nakama encourages developers to [use scripting](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/server-framework/introduction/index.html) to extend the server. While the scripting is extensive, it's not intended for all use cases.

This means Nakama has first-class services written in Go and asks you to write second-class code written in a scripting language without access to a mature database.

Open Game Backend is designed from the ground up to be modular at its core. It provides a set of official modules to get you started quickly, but the primary use case is to extend the server with your own modules. All modules are first-class citizens have access to a mature database.
