## Why do we pull source code instead of bundling modules?

The OpenGB dev experience encourages developers to view & fork the source code of other modules. By downloading the original source files, developers can jump to the source code of their dependencies from their IDE.

Downloading a bundle would require developers to manually find the repository & ref of their dependencies on GitHub.
