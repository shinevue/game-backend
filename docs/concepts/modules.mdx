## What are modules?

Modules are pieces of backend functionality that can be combined together to build & customize your game's backend.

Modules include:

- **Scripts** that implement the logic.
- **Database** schemas to store persistent data.
- **User configuration** to let you configure settings on the module.
- **Explicit errors** to make it easy to understand & recover from errors returned from the module.

You can think of modules like an NPM package/Unity package/Unreal plugin/Maven artifact/Rust crate but with a persistence layer and a standard + well-documented way of using it.

## How do I install modules?

To install a module from the default registry, you have two options.

### CLI

You can install the module from the CLI by running the following command:

```sh
opengb module add my_module
```

This will update your `backend.json` file accordingly.

### `backend.json`

You can also manually add the module to your `backend.json` file manually, like this:

```json
{
	"modules": {
		"my_module": {
			"config": {
        // Your config here
      }
		}
	}
}
```

## Registries

Modules come from registries. OpenGB provides a default registry with all of the modules available on this website. You can specify or host your own registries easily. Read more [here](/concepts/registries).
