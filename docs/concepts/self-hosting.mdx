# Self-Hosting

<Note>This documentation page is a work in progress.</Note>

## Overview

This guide will walk you through self-hosting Open Game Backend on a virtual machine.

TODO: explain this is going to run everything on a single vm, suitable for hobby deployments

## Prerequisites

- Linux VM with Debian 11
    - You can rent a VM from Linode, Digital Ocean, or AWS
- [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Git

<Info>This guide works with most Linux distributions, but is not tested. Reach out on [Discord](https://rivet.gg/discord) if you have questions.</Info>

## Upload To Server

TODO: demonstrate using git clone of their own repo

## Configure firewall

Open port 80

## Write Dockerfile

TODO: not using opengb dev for prod

```dockerfile
# TODO: Need dockerfile for opengb
- from debian
- install opengb (pin version)
- opengb build
- set cmd to `deno run .opengb/entrypoint.ts`
```

## Write Docker Compose

TODO: quickly explain how this works

```yaml docker-compose.yaml
# TODO: Not tested
services:
  opengb:
    build: .
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy

  db-migrate:
    build: .
    entrypoint: ["opengb", "db", "deploy"]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
 
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 10
```

## Up

```
docker-compose up -d
```

```
docker-compose logs
```

## Next Steps

- Set up SSL
- Secure Postgres database credentials
- Monitor with docker-compose logs
