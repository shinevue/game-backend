title: "Sharing a backend across multiple games"
---

## Motivation

It's common for studios to have multiple games and want to share backend data across them. For example, a studio might want to share user accounts & friends across games, but keep game-specific data like leaderboards & achievements separate.

## Multiple module instances

If we have a `leaderboard` module and we want to run multiple instances of it for the games `foo` and `bar`, we can use module aliases to create multiple instances of the module.

```json
{
	"modules": {
    // Users module is shared across all games
		"users": {},
    // Leaderboard for game `food`
		"foo_leaderboard": {
			"module": "leaderboard"
		},
    // Leaderboard for game `bar`
		"bar_leaderboard": {
			"module": "leaderboard"
		}
	}
}
```

This will create an isolated database for each game's leaderboard.

To get the scores from the `foo` leaderboard, we can use the `foo_leaderboard` module:

```js
const fooScores = await ctx.modules.fooLeaderboard.getScores();
```
