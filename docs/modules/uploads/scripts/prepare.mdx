## Request

```typescript
export interface Request {
  metadata?: any;
  files: MultipartUploadFile[];
}
export interface MultipartUploadFile {
  multipart: boolean;
  path: string;
  mime: null | string;
  /**
   * The size of the file in bytes.
   *
   * *(This is a string instead of a bigint because JSON doesn't support
   * serializing/deserializing bigints, and we want to be able to represent
   * very large file sizes.)*
   */
  contentLength: string;
}
```

## Response

```typescript
